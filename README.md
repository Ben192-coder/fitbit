### 🧠 Key Insights  
- Most Fitbit users track steps & calories but not sleep or heart rate → opportunity for product expansion  
- Activity levels highest on weekdays; lowest on weekends → scheduling opportunity for reminders  
- Daily activity strongly correlates with calories burned → potential insight for goal-setting features  
- High variability in sleep patterns → potential for coaching or automated sleep analysis  

### 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Data cleaning (wide → long conversions)  
- Aggregations (daily, hourly, user-level summaries)  
- Feature engineering (activity levels, sleep tiers, intensity zones)  
- R: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `janitor`  
- Data storytelling with RMarkdown
